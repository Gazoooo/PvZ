# PvZ
A game like Plans vs. Zombies on Jupyter Notebooks.  
I created it in my 1. Semester in a course at University Osnabrueck.  
Because it uses the Extension 'AlgoViz', which was specially designed for us students, it won't work properly without this.  
A tutorial to get it run us found [here](https://abbozza.informatik.uni-osnabrueck.de/algoviz/), but I didn't test it!
